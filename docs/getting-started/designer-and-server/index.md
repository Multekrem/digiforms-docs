# Designer and Server

Digiforms is divided into two primary components with distinct responsibilities.

## Digiforms Designer

Designer is used to:

- Define XML data models
- Build PDF templates
- Build web templates
- Configure layout and bindings

Designer is a development tool.

## Digiforms Server

Server is responsible for:

- Executing web applications
- Generating PDF documents
- Managing integrations
- Enforcing security policies
- Running custom plugins

Server is the runtime environment.

Understanding this separation is essential when planning architecture and deployments.
