# Datasources

Datasources provide additional XML-based data to templates.

They may include:

- External XML endpoints
- Local document-level data
- Server-provided metadata

Datasources are implemented using XSLT constructs and can be cached by Digiforms Server.

Usage differs between PDF and Web templates.
