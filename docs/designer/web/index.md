# Web Applications

Digiforms Designer can be used to create XML-driven web interfaces that run on Digiforms Server.

Unlike PDF templates, web templates define interactive user interfaces for data capture, validation and process-driven workflows.

---

## How Web solutions work

Web templates in Digiforms are:

- XML-driven
- Bound to data using XPath
- Structured through page templates
- Rendered dynamically by Digiforms Server

The Designer defines layout and interaction logic, while the Server handles runtime, process flow and integrations.

See:

- [Digiforms Server](../../server/index.md)

## Typical use cases

Web templates are commonly used to build:

- Data capture forms
- Multi-step wizards
- Case submission systems
- Self-service portals
- Integration-driven e-services

Web solutions can combine:

- Input validation
- Business rules
- Document generation
- Integration with external systems

---

## Core building blocks

Web templates are structured using:

- Page templates
- Form controls
- Validation rules
- Layout definitions
- Datasources

See:

- [Page Templates](page-templates/index.md)
- [Form Controls](form-controls/index.md)
- [Validation](validation/index.md)
- [Layout](layout/index.md)
- [Datasources in Web](datasources/index.md)

---

## Interaction and data binding

Web interfaces bind XML data to form controls using XPath expressions.

Data can be validated, transformed and reused across multiple pages and workflows.

## Deployment

Web templates require Digiforms Server for runtime execution, authentication, integration and process handling.
